        <p> Secrets of the <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank">Javascript</a> Ninja takes
            you on a journey towards mastering modern JavaScript development in three phases: design, construction, and
            maintenance. Written for JavaScript developers with intermediate-level skills, <span
                class="textoPrincipalDelFinal"> this book will give you the knowledge you need to create a cross-browser
                JavaScript library from the ground up.</span></p>

        <h2>About the Technology</h2>
        JavaScript developers commonly rely on collections of reusable JavaScript code—written by themselves or by
        someone else at their company. Alternatively, they rely on code from a third party. But in all these cases they
        need to know how to either construct a cross-browser library from scratch or be adept at using and maintaining
        their library of choice.

        <h2>About the book</h2>
        You can't always attack software head-on. Sometimes you come at it sideways or sneak up from behind. You need to
        master an arsenal of tools and know every stealthy trick. You have to be a ninja.
        <br>
        <br>
        Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja leads you down the pathway to JavaScript enlightenment. This unique book starts
        with key concepts, like the relationships between functions, objects, and closures, taught from the master's
        perspective. You'll grow from apprentice to ninja as you soak up fresh insights on the techniques you use every
        day and discover features and capabilities you never knew about. When you reach the final chapters, you'll be
        ready to code brilliant JavaScript applications and maybe even write your own libraries and frameworks.
        <br>

        You don't have to be a ninja to read this book—just be willing to become one. Are you ready?
